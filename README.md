# ðŸ¤– Mini AI Project: Supervised Classification After K-Means Clustering

This project demonstrates a machine learning pipeline where **unsupervised clustering** (K-Means) is first applied to a dataset, followed by **supervised classification** using three models:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest

The goal is to assess the performance of each classifier based on standard evaluation metrics.

## ðŸ§  Objectives

- Apply **K-Means clustering** to structure unlabeled data.
- Assign cluster labels as pseudo-labels for supervised learning.
- Train and compare three classifiers: **KNN**, **SVM**, and **Random Forest**.
- Evaluate the models using classification metrics: **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
- Visualize and interpret the results.

- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ For machine learning models and evaluation
- **Pandas** â€“ For data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** â€“ For plotting and visualizations
